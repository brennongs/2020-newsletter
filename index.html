<h1>The Schows - A Year in Review</h1>
<h2>2021 in a Nutshell</h2>

<p>2021 Has been a wonderful year for the Schow family! We’ve gone on so many adventures, from hikes to train rides to airplane rides and more. We loved being able to go on vacation again after not traveling for most of 2020, and were able to visit family in Rochester, Minnesota as well as finally fulfill our dream of seeing the Redwood National Forest!</p>

<p><strong>Bethany</strong> (6) learned to read and ride a bike, swim the length of Grandma and Grandpa’s pool, and do hand stands and cartwheels! She loves to be active through dance, tumbling, jumping on the trampoline, hiking, or pretty much any other excuse to move her body! She is constantly making up songs with her voice, the piano, and her ukulele and is loving her “Let’s Play Music” class. She’s a wonderful helper with her siblings and an instant friend to everyone she meets.</p>

<p><strong>Magnolia</strong> (4) has the most in depth imagination of anyone we know! She tries to play as many different characters at once as possible, and expects us to keep them all straight. She loves to sing and dance for us and is very attached to her dance and music teachers. She loves all things sparkles and princess and tutus and is very opinionated about her wardrobe. She follows Bennie and her friends everywhere and wants to be just like her big sister! When not playing or performing, she can be found with her face in a book. She is obsessed with babies and can’t wait to be a mom. She’s the perfect combination of sweetness and sass and we can’t get enough!</p>

<p><strong>Wesley</strong> (1) loves animals, being outside, having his teeth and hair brushed, loud noises, baths, tickles, belly buttons, and anything with wheels. He just started walking at 15 months but has been climbing everything and anything for several months now. He has gotten himself stuck in many creative places and we’ve had to baby proof like never before! He is the most aggressive cuddler and is pretty much always happy. We’re also pretty sure he is a musical prodigy.

<p><strong>Jaymalyn</strong> loves being a stay at home mom to our 3 busy kids and has especially loved starting homeschooling the girls this year! It has been one of the most challenging but rewarding parenting experiences and a much better fit for our family than traditional school. She’s also loved doing lots of yoga, taking the kids on walks with her mom, or swimming when the weather permits. </p>

<p><strong>Brennon</strong> spent most of the year writing music, reading books to our family, and working as a software engineer at GuideCX. He loves game nights, cooking for people, and being active. He’s perfected his head stand and made lots of progress on his hand stand! He is still on the lookout for a rock climbing buddy.</p>

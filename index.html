<h1>The Schows - A Year in Review</h1>
<h2>2020 in a Nutshell</h2>

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/brennongs/image/upload/v1608648609/2020-newsletter/full-family.jpg" alt="the schow family" id="full-family">
<p>Happy last few days of 2020! The Schow family has missed being together with so many of you this year. We are grateful for the chances we've had to spend time with some of you in person and many of you virtually! We hope next year we can get back to our beloved past time of hosting dinner parties and game nights. We continually pray for the health and safety of our loved ones, progress for the people working so hard to create and distribute a vaccine for this virus, and the stabilization of the economy and life in general. We are hopeful that things will look up soon!</p>

<p>2020 has been a year of change for us! Brennon changed jobs after a year and a half at FamilySearch. He also started working from home during COVID, which was a big adjustment at first but has given us a lot more time together as a family - most of which has been spent exploring in the mountains. Other changes included having a baby and buying a home! It has been a year of adventure and growth!</p>

<p>Brennon loves his job as a software developer at GuideCX. He is a self-proclaimed minimalist and really just wants to get rid of all of our stuff and move off the grid. He stays up way too late many nights writing and producing music. PSA: He is currently looking for a hiking/backpacking/canyoneering buddy. (also, he grew all his hair back &#128527)</p>

<p>Jayme spent the spare minutes of quarantine organizing every space of our Orem house...just in time to move &#129299. But she is grateful for all she learned about organizing during that time and is excited to get a fresh start in the new space and hopefully have it set up soon. She has done lots of yoga and is currently taking an intro course in teaching kids yoga as well as finishing up her certifications as a Postpartum Doula and Lactation Support Educator.</p>

<p>Bennie (Bethany, age 5) absolutely loves kindergarten and her angel teacher, Mrs. Holden! When she's not at school, she can often be found playing school or practicing her writing, reading, and numbers. She loves to dance, sing, and perform, and she has nearly learned to whistle! She can do several different accents and character voices and will correct you if you do the voices wrong when reading to her (especially with <em>Narnia</em> and <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>).</p>

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/brennongs/image/upload/v1608649237/2020-newsletter/lia.jpg" alt="lia likes to be nice most of the time" id="lia">
<p>Lia (Magnolia, age 3) is one of the most charismatic, melodramatic humans we have ever met. There is always a story going on in her head, and she can play and imagine in her own little world for hours on end. She is in the "I'm not Lia I'm _____" phase, and if you call her by the wrong name, she won't respond. This proves difficult as she could be Rapunzel, Elsa, Anna, Christopher Robin, Megan, Katey, Barbie, Skipper, and a dozen others in the course of a day.) We have learned to resort to calling her all of the names we can think of until she answers. Quarantine was exactly what Lia needed to blossom and come out of her shell! Introverts! &#129335;&#8205;&#9792;&#65039;</p>

<p>Boy (Wesley, age 4 months) started the year off strong by being born - his biggest accomplishment to date. He is exactly what our family needed this year. He is a patient, peaceful boy who always has smiles and snuggles to give! He loves breastfeeding but already has two teeth, so Jayme isn't sure how much longer she can handle being a chew toy. He adores his dad and receives endless entertainment from his two older sisters/extra mommies. He recently discovered his tongue and is very excited about it.</p>
